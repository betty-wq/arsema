                <h2 class="abouthead">A Faith Process</h2>
                    <p class="aboutp">It is God who plants a church. He first plants churches in the hearts of faithful people. Once
                     planted, the seed of a church in the heart of a leader goes through a nurturing process.
                     &quot;For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and
                     appoint elders in every city as I commanded you—&quot; (Titus 1:5).Paul’s missionary journeys
                     produced great fruit. The churches which were produced required practical care at their inception
                     and on an on-going basis. Spiritually gifted leaders like Titus saw to that practical care – setting
                     things in order and appointing leaders as needed. We Christians, especially those chosen to serve
                     God’s purpose, have the responsibility of spreading the word of God and shepherd his ships.</p>
                <h2 class="abouthead">Historical Background</h2>
                     <p class="aboutp">The Ethiopian Orthodox church is one of the ancient churches with a history of more than 2000
                     years. Ethiopia accepted Christianity in the first century when its Treasure came to Jerusalem 34
                      AD. Ethiopia has accepted the old covenant during the Solomonic Era and has been worshipping
God since that time. After the coming of Jesus Christ Ethiopia accepted Christianity through its
representatives who visit Jerusalem every year during Easter time. Ethiopia sends its
representative to Jerusalem every year during this time when Israelis come together to celebrate
their freedom from Egypt as ordered by God in the Old Testament. As St. Luke described in Acts
Vs 8, the Ethiopian Treasure was reading part of the bible and the Holy spirit ordered Philip to
go and baptize the Ethiopian Treasure and explained to him the versus he was reading, Isa 53,
which talks about our savior Jesus Christ’s suffering and sacrifice. The treasures then came back
to Ethiopia and started preaching what he had learnt during his annual visit of Jerusalem. He was
representing Ethiopians in the event of the annual Easter. He came with new evangelical news and
preached the King and the Queen and the citizens. Since then Ethiopia has accepted Christianity
as its sole religion and worshiped the King, Jesus Christ. The country embraced Christianity and
maintained the doctrine of Christ from the era of the Apostles to the present day, as it is narrated
in (Acts 8:26-39). The history of St. Philip the Apostle baptizing the Eunuch who was very
much interested in religion is of great interest for the Ethiopian Church history. This Eunuch was
a man of high rank, the finance minister of Candace Queen of Ethiopia.</p>
                     <p class="aboutp">Eusebius speaks of him as the first fruits of the faithful in the whole world. Irenius writes that
he preached the Gospel of the Ethiopians. Other evidence is that during the time that the Eunuch
preached Christianity, Ethiopian women wore crosses upon their heads signifying the recognition
of the Crucifixion of Christ. Besides St. John Chrysostom witnessed that among those who were
present at Pentecost (the birth of the Universal Church) were Ethiopians. In the history of the
Church, it is further recorded that St. Matthew the Apostle preached the Gospel to the Ethiopians
and won a few converts to the new doctrine and left the country.</p>
                     <p class="aboutp">As is with all Oriental Orthodox Churches the teachings of the Church is founded on the
Apostles experience of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Creator and Savior of the World.
The first three ecumenical councils Nicaea 325, Constantinople 381, and Ephesus 431 which
confessed the Son of God as being of substance with the Father and condemned Arius&#39; formula
are accepted by the Ethiopian orthodox Church, but the Church refuses to accept the Council of
Chalcedon 451 presided by Pope Leo I which teaches the formula of the &quot;two natures&quot; against
that of &quot;one nature&quot; the teaching of St. Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria. The Ethiopian Church
holds that there were two natures before incarnation, but only one after the union. Human
nature was not dissolved in the Divine as Eutyches taught. But rather, the Divine made the
human nature immediately its own. The word and the human constitute one nature, and union is
established without confusion and without division. The Church rejects the idea of Eutyches, the
monophysite who taught a confusion against the union of the human by the Divine, which was
regarded by (Dyophysite) theologians to be the same with teaching of the Ethiopian Church and
its sister Churches, which was done without investigation and hence ignorance because
Eutryches&#39; condemnation by St. Dioscorus is an evidence to the point. One can see that the
words, &quot;dysophysite&quot; and &quot;monophysite&quot; as fitting to play a great role not between the oriental
Churches which have nothing to do with such phrases but between the Caldedonian and
Eutyches himself.</p>
                     <p class="aboutp">The Church emphasizes that all concerning Christ should be applied to His entire person as one
Lord. Not to single out the &quot;Human nature&quot; as subjected to suffering hunger, passion etc.,
Properties peculiar to the human are referred to His Divine powers as God suffered, God was
crucified, God shed blood, God died, and God was risen up for the salvation of all men.
The seven sacraments (mysteries) Baptism, Confirmation, penance, Holy Communion, Unction
of the Sick, Matrimony and Holy Orders are important in the teaching of the E.O.C. The
administration of these sacraments is somehow similar to that of other Eastern Orthodox
Churches in many ways. But with more native elements especially in hymary (chanting) and the
custom of rites. Sacraments are holy ordinance through which the believer receives an invisible
grace under the form of an outward sign. In the performance of each sacrament the Divine
Majesty Himself is present.</p>
                     <p class="aboutp">Also the Church teaches other five pillars of Mysteries. They are the Mystery of the Trinity,
Incarnation, Baptism, Eucharist and the Mystery of the Resurrection of the dead. These
Mysteries are regarded by the Church as basic knowledge for all faithful and every Christian
must know this. Fasting is strictly observed by all baptized members above the age of seven
years. During lent; meat, and products of meat are prohibited.</p>
                     <p class="aboutp">Furthermore all faithful must keep the Ten Commandments and the six parables in Matt. 25:35-
36, in order to inherit eternal life. In the second coming of Christ the dead will be raised and
sinners will receive punishment according to their deed. So man is responsible for his own
committed sins.
The church has built a strong relationship with the Coptic Church and shared different Christian
values and experiences with sister churches. Although Ethiopia entertains different religious such
as Muslim since the 15 th century, Majority of the people, more than 60%, are Christians and
worship Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="abouthead">Ethiopians in Exile</h2>
<p class="aboutp">Due to Political, Economic, Educational and other reasons many Ethiopians exiled to the various
parts of the world. As Israelis used to do during their exile in Babylon, the Ethiopians spread all
over the world and continued worshipping their God wherever they are and whenever they can.
Studies depict that more than a million Ethiopian immigrants live in the United States of
America of which one fifth of them reside in the Washington DC area including The CommonWealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland. The Ethiopian church has played pivotal role in
maintaining the unity of the country and development of unique humble personality amongst its
fellowship, and significantly cooperated with other international churches for the spread of
evangelism. Living in Exile brings a lot of opportunities, experiences and challenges. Many
Ethiopians who come to the United States have a greater challenge of coping with the cultural
shock, language barriers and understanding of the American way of life. Although many of them
have the interest of allotting time for their God to worship there are few who got lost and
involved in criminal activities. The church has the responsibility of shepherding its fellow
members, helping them cope with the cultural differences, and also helping them to maintain a
balanced life, understanding American way of living and of all showing and directing them
God’s path.</p>

    By whom all things were made, and without Him nothing in heaven or earth made: Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, was made man and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and from the holy Virgin Mary. Became man, was crucified for our sakes in the days of Pontius Pilate, suffered, died, was buried and 
    rose from the dead on the third day as written in the holy scriptures ascended in glory into heaven, sits at the right hand of His Father, and will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead; there is no end of His reign.

    worship and glorify Him with the Father and the Son; who spoke by the prophets; And we believe in on holy, universal, apostolic church, And we believe in one baptism for the remission of sins, and wait for the resurrection from the dead and the life to come, world without end.
